abstract: In healthcare applications, temporal variables that encode movement, health
  status, and longitudinal patient evolution are often accompanied by rich structured
  information such as demographics, diagnostics and medical exam data. However, current
  methods do not jointly optimize over structured covariates and time series in the
  feature extraction process. We present ShortFuse, a method that boosts the accuracy
  of deep learning models for time series by explicitly modeling temporal interactions
  and dependencies with structured covariates. ShortFuse introduces hybrid convolutional
  and LSTM cells that incorporate the covariates via weights that are shared across
  the temporal domain. ShortFuse outperforms competing models by 3% on two biomedical
  applications, forecasting osteoarthritis-related cartilage degeneration and predicting
  surgical outcomes for cerebral palsy patients.
