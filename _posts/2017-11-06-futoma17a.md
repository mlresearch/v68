abstract: Sepsis is a poorly understood and potentially life-threatening complication
  that can occur as a result of infection. Early detection and treatmenz improves
  patient outcomes, and as such it poses an important challenge in medicine. In this
  work, we develop a flexible classifier that leverages streaming lab results, vitals,
  and medications to predict sepsis before it occurs. We model patient clinical time
  series with multi-output Gaussian processes, maintaining uncertainty about the physiological
  state of a patient while also imputing missing values. The mean function takes into
  account the effects of medications administered on the trajectories of the physiological
  variables. Latent function values from the Gaussian process are then fed into a
  deep recurrent neural network to classify patient encounters as septic or not, and
  the overall model is trained end-to-end using back-propagation. We train and validate
  our model on a large dataset of 18 months of heterogeneous inpatient stays from
  the Duke University Health System, and develop a new “real-time” validation scheme
  for simulat-ing the performance of our model as it will actually be used. Our proposed
  method substantially outperforms clinical baselines, and improves on a previous
  related model for detecting sepsis. Our model’s predictions will be displayed in
  a real-time analytics dashboard to be used by a sepsis rapid response team to help
  detect and improve treatment of sepsis.
