abstract: Clinical diagnostic inferencing is a complex task, which often requires
  significant medical research and investigation based on an underlying clinical scenario.
  This paper proposes a novel approach by formulating the task as a reinforcement
  learning problem such that the system can infer the most probable diagnoses by optimizing
  clinical concept extraction from a free text case narrative via leveraging relevant
  external evidence. Such a formulation is deemed to be suitable due to the inherent
  complexity of the task and unavailability of sufficient annotated data. During training,
  the agent tries to learn the optimal policy through iterative search and consolidation
  of the most relevant clinical concepts that best describe a correct diagnosis. A
  deep Q-network architecture is trained to optimize a reward function that measures
  the accuracy of the candidate diagnoses and clinical concepts. Our preliminary experiments
  on the TREC CDS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our system over non-reinforcement
  learning-based strong baselines.
