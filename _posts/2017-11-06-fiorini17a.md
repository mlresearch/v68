abstract: Multiple Sclerosis is a degenerative condition of the central nervous system
  that affects nearly 2.5 million of individuals in terms of their physical, cognitive,
  psychological and social capabilities. Despite the high variability of its clinical
  presentation, relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis are considered the two
  main disease types, with the former possibly evolving into the latter. Recently,
  the attention of the medical community toward the use of patient-centered outcomes
  in multiple sclerosis has significantly increased. Such patient-friendly measures
  are devoted to the assessment of the impact of the disease on several domains of
  the patient life. In this work, we investigate on use of patient-centered outcomes
  to predict the evolution of the disease and to assess its impact on patientsâ€™ lives.
  To this aim, we build a novel temporal model based on gradient boosting classification
  and multiple-output elastic-net regression. The model provides clinically interpretable
  results along with accurate predictions of the disease course evolution.
