abstract: Logged events occur both regularly and irregularly over time. In electronic
  health records, these events represent mixtures of scheduled and urgent or emergent
  encounters. Whereas most survival models use baseline events to estimate the rate
  function for an outcome, e.g., Cox processes using the proportional-hazards assumption,
  our framework uses logged events over time to predict survival outcomes with piecewise
  approximations of arbitrary hazard functions. We develop a procedure to learn forests
  as combinations of piecewise-constant and parameterized distributions to compactly
  model survival distributions from data. Under this construction, the model provides
  a “now-time” risk that incorporates irregularly-repeated data and for health outcomes
  serves as a surrogate for patient disposition. We illustrate the advantages of our
  method in simulations and in longitudinal, intensive care unit data of individuals
  with diabetes admitted for ketoacidosis.
