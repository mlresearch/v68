abstract: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) discovery is the task of identifying unexpected
  and negative events caused by pharmaceutical products. This paper describes a log-linear
  Hawkes process model for ADR discovery from longitudinal observational data such
  as electronic health records (EHRs). The proposed method leverages the irregular
  time-stamped events in EHRs to represent the time-varying effect of various drugs
  on the occurrence rate of adverse events. Experimental results on a large-scale
  cohort of real-world EHRs demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a leading
  approach, multiple self-controlled case series (Simpson et al., 2013), in identifying
  benchmark ADRs defined by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership.
