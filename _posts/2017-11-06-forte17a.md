abstract: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery is the most common cardiac operation
  and its complications are associated with increased long-term mortality rates. Although
  many factors are known to be linked to this, much remains to be understood about
  their exact influence on outcome. In this study we used Machine Learning (ML) algorithms
  to predict long-term mortality in CABG patients using data from routinely measured
  clinical parameters from a large cohort of CABG patients (n=5868). We compared the
  accuracy of 5 different ML models with traditional Cox and Logistic Regression,
  and report the most important variables in the best performing models. In the validation
  dataset, the Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM) algorithm was the most accurate (AUROC
  curve [95%CI] of 0.767 [0.739-0.796]), proving to be superior to traditional Cox
  and logistic regression (p <0.01) for long-term mortality prediction. Measures of
  variable importance for outcome prediction extracted from the GBM and Random Forest
  models partly reflected what is known in the literature, but interestingly also
  highlighted other unexpectedly relevant parameters. In conclusion, we found ML algorithm-based
  models to be more accurate than traditional Logistic Regression in predicting long-term
  mortality after CABG. Finally, these models may provide essential input to assist
  the development of intelligent decision support systems for clinical use.
