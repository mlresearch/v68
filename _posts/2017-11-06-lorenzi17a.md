abstract: We develop a novel algorithm, Predictive Hierarchical Clustering (PHC),
  for agglomerative hierarchical clustering of current procedural terminology (CPT)
  codes. Our predictive hierarchical clustering aims to cluster subgroups, not individual
  observations, found within our data, such that the clusters discovered result in
  optimal performance of a classification model. Therefore, merges are chosen based
  on a Bayesian hypothesis test, which chooses pairings of the subgroups that result
  in the best model fit, as measured by held out predictive likelihoods. We place
  a Dirichlet prior on the probability of merging clusters, allowing us to adjust
  the size and sparsity of clusters. The motivation is to predict patient-specific
  surgical outcomes using data from ACS NSQIP (American College of Surgeonâ€™s National
  Surgical Quality Improvement Program). An important predictor of surgical outcomes
  is the actual surgical procedure performed as described by a CPT code. We use PHC
  to cluster CPT codes, represented as subgroups, together in a way that enables us
  to better predict patient-specific outcomes compared to currently used clusters
  based on clinical judgment.
