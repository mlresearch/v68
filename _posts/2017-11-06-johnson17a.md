abstract: Mortality prediction of intensive care unit (ICU) patients facilitates hospital
  benchmarking and has the opportunity to provide caregivers with useful summaries
  of patient health at the bedside. The development of novel models for mortality
  prediction is a popular task in machine learning, with researchers typically seeking
  to maximize measures such as the area under the receiver operator characteristic
  curve (AUROC). The number of ’researcher degrees of freedom’ that contribute to
  the performance of a model, however, presents a challenge when seeking to compare
  reported performance of such models. In this study, we review publications that
  have reported performance of mortality prediction models based on the Medical Information
  Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database and attempt to reproduce the cohorts used
  in their studies. We then compare the performance reported in the studies against
  gradient boosting and logistic regression models using a simple set of features
  extracted from MIMIC. We demonstrate the large heterogeneity in studies that purport
  to conduct the single task of ’mortality prediction’, highlighting the need for
  improvements in the way that prediction tasks are reported to enable fairer comparison
  between models. We reproduced datasets for 38 experiments corresponding to 28 published
  studies using MIMIC. In half of the experiments, the sample size we acquired was
  25% greater or smaller than the sample size reported. The highest discrepancy was
  11,767 patients. While accurate reproduction of each study cannot be guaranteed,
  we believe that these results highlight the need for more consistent reporting of
  model design and methodology to allow performance improvements to be compared. We
  discuss the challenges in reproducing the cohorts used in the studies, highlighting
  the importance of clearly reported methods (e.g. data cleansing, variable selection,
  cohort selection) and the need for open code and publicly available benchmarks.
