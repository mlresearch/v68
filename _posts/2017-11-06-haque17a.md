abstract: One in twenty-five patients admitted to a hospital will suffer from a hospital
  acquired infection. If we can intelligently track healthcare staff, patients, and
  visitors, we can better understand the sources of such infections. We envision a
  smart hospital capable of increasing operational efficiency and improving patient
  care with less spending. In this paper, we propose a non-intrusive vision-based
  system for tracking people’s activity in hospitals. We evaluate our method for the
  problem of measuring hand hygiene compliance. Empirically, our method outperforms
  existing solutions such as proximity-based techniques and covert in-person observational
  studies. We present intuitive, qualitative results that analyze human movement patterns
  and conduct spatial analytics which convey our method’s interpretability. This work
  is a first step towards a computer-vision based smart hospital and demonstrates
  promising results for reducing hospital acquired infections.
