abstract: Research in oncology quality of care and health outcomes has been limited
  by the difficulty of identifying cancer stage in health care claims data. Using
  linked cancer registry and Medicare claims data, we develop a tool for classifying
  lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy into early vs. late stage cancer by
  (i) deploying ensemble machine learning for prediction, (ii) establishing a set
  of classification rules for the predicted probabilities, and (iii) considering an
  augmented set of administrative claims data. We find our ensemble machine learning
  algorithm with a classification rule defined by the median substantially outperforms
  an existing clinical decision tree for this problem, yielding full sample performance
  of 93% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and 93% accuracy. This work has the potential
  for broad applicability as provider organizations, payers, and policy makers seek
  to measure quality and outcomes of cancer care and improve on risk adjustment methods.
