abstract: In this paper, we propose a computer vision based method to assess the technical
  skill level of surgeons by analyzing the movement of robotic instruments in robotic
  surgical videos. First, our method leverages the power of crowd workers on the internet
  to obtain high quality data in a scalable and cost-efficient way. Second, we utilize
  the high quality data to train an accurate and efficient robotic instrument tracker
  based on the state-of-the-art Hourglass Networks. Third, we assess the movement
  of the robotic instruments and automatically classify the technical level of a surgeon
  with a linear classifier, using peer evaluations of skill as the reference standard.
  Since the proposed method relies only on video data, this method has the potential
  to be transferred to other minimally invasive surgical procedures.
