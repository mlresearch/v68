abstract: 'Mental illnesses adversely affect a significant proportion of the population
  worldwide. However, the typical methods to estimate and characterize the prevalence
  of mental health conditions are time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, best-available
  estimates concerning the prevalence of these conditions are often years out of date.
  Automated approaches that supplement traditional methods with broad, aggregated
  information derived from social media provide a potential means of furnishing near
  real-time estimates at scale. These may in turn provide grist for supporting, evaluating
  and iteratively improving public health programs and interventions. We propose a
  novel approach for mental health quantification that leverages user em-beddings
  induced from social media post histories. Recent work showed that learned user representations
  capture latent aspects of individuals (e.g., political leanings). This paper investigates
  whether these representations also correlate with mental health statuses. To this
  end, we induced embeddings for a set of users known to be affected by depression
  and post-traumatic stress disorder, and for a set of demographically matched ‘control’
  users. We then evaluated the induced user representations with respect to: (i) their
  ability to capture homophilic relations with respect to mental health statuses;
  and (ii) their predictive performance in downstream mental health models. Our experimental
  results demonstrate that learned user embeddings capture relevant signals for mental
  health quantification.'
