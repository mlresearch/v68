abstract: For many movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and ataxia, disease
  progression is visually assessed by a clinician using a numerical disease rating
  scale. These tests are subjective, time-consuming, and must be administered by a
  professional. This can be problematic where specialists are not available, or when
  a patient is not consistently evaluated by the same clinician. We present an automated
  method for quantifying the severity of motion impairment in patients with ataxia,
  using only video recordings. We consider videos of the finger-to-nose test, a common
  movement task used as part of the assessment of ataxia progression during the course
  of routine clinical checkups. Our method uses neural network-based pose estimation
  and optical flow techniques to track the motion of the patient’s hand in a video
  recording. We extract features that describe qualities of the motion such as speed
  and variation in performance. Using labels provided by an expert clinician, we train
  a supervised learning model that predicts severity according to the Brief Ataxia
  Rating Scale (BARS). The performance of our system is comparable to that of a group
  of ataxia specialists in terms of mean error and correlation, and our system’s predictions
  were consistently within the range of inter-rater variability. This work demonstrates
  the feasibility of using computer vision and machine learning to produce consistent
  and clinically useful measures of motor impairment.
