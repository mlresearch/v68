abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and
  costs hospitals billions annually. Treating a septic patient is highly challenging,
  because individual patients respond very differently to medical interventions and
  there is no universally agreed-upon treatment for sepsis. Understanding more about
  a patient’s physiological state at a given time could hold the key to effective
  treatment policies. In this work, we propose a new approach to deduce optimal treatment
  policies for septic patients by using continuous state-space models and deep reinforcement
  learning. Learning treatment policies over continuous state-spaces is important,
  because doing so allows us to retain more of the patient’s physiological information.
  Our model is able to learn clinically interpretable treatment policies, similar
  in important aspects to the treatment policies of physicians. Evaluating our algorithm
  on past ICU patient data, we find that our model could reduce absolute patient mortality
  in the hospital by up to 3.6% over observed clinical policies. The learned treatment
  policies could be used to aid intensive care clinicians in medical decision making
  and improve the likelihood of patient survival.
