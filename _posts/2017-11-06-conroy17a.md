abstract: 'We present a multiple kernel learning framework to learn similarity functions
  that compare physiological state between patients. A powerful ensemble kernel is
  learned from many base kernels evaluated on individual features. Our proposed framework
  captures two aspects of patient similarity: that patient similarity should be dependent
  on clinical context and that similarity should be modulated by the frequency and
  specificity of individual feature values. We validate our model on ICU data to predict
  hemodynamic instability and present analyses on using the patient similarity function
  to construct personalized cohorts. Our experiments show that the statistical properties
  learned by the kernels functions based on feature population distributions are significantly
  more predictive than naive stationary kernels (e.g. RBFs). Population-based kernels
  outperform RBFâ€™s in identifying patient cohorts based on abnormality of their vitals
  and lab measurements and at predicting mortality.'
