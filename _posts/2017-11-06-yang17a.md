abstract: In this work we attempt to predict the progression-free survival time of
  metastatic breast cancer patients by combining state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
  with traditional survival analysis models. In order to tackle the challenge of sequential
  clinical records being both high-dimensional and sparse, we propose to apply a tensorized
  recurrent neural network architecture to extract a latent representation from the
  entire patient history. We use this as the input to an Accelerated Failure Time
  model that predicts the survival time. Our experiments, conducted on a large real-world
  clinical dataset, demonstrate that the tensorized recurrent neural network largely
  reduces the number of weight parameters and the training time. It also achieves
  modest improvements in prediction, in comparison with state-of-the-art recurrent
  neural network models enhanced with event embeddings.
