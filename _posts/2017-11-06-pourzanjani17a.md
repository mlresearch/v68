abstract: Death from trauma is most often the result of uncontrollable bleeding as
  a result of Acute Traumatic Coagulopathy (ATC), a disease that manifests itself
  differently in different sub-cohorts of trauma patients. Understanding the mechanisms
  of ATC and how existing patient tests can inform us about these mechanisms is key
  to treating the disease. We introduce a hierarchical Canonical Correlation Analysis
  (CCA) model that captures a lower dimensional representation of the coagulation
  system based on blood protein and other tests. The hierarchial nature of the model
  is ideal in the setting where multiple sub-cohorts are present, but statistical
  strength can reasonably be borrowed from similar groups. We illustrate how the model
  may be useful in understanding and treating ATC.
