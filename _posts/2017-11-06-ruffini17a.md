abstract: In this paper we present a method for the unsupervised clustering of high-dimensional
  binary data, with a special focus on electronic healthcare records. We present a
  robust and efficient heuristic to face this problem using tensor decomposition.
  We present the reasons why this approach is preferable for tasks such as clustering
  patient records, to more commonly used distance-based methods. We run the algorithm
  on two datasets of healthcare records, obtaining clinically meaningful results.
