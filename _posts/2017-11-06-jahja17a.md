abstract: The goal of this work is to better convey the evidence for or against clinically
  significant differences in patient outcomes induced by different treatment policies.
  In pursuit of this goal, we present a framework for computing and presenting prediction
  regions and tolerance regions for the outcomes of a treatment policy operating within
  a multi-objective Markov decision process (MOMDP). Our framework draws on two bodies
  of existing work, one in computer science for learning in MOMDPs, and one in statistics
  for uncertainty quantification. We review the relevant methods from each body of
  work, present our framework, and illustrate its use using data from the Clinical
  Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (Schizophrenia). Finally, we
  discuss potential future directions of this work for supporting sequential decision-making.
