abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) consist of sparse, noisy, incomplete, heterogeneous
  and unevenly sampled clinical data of patients. They include physiological signals,
  lab test results, procedural events, clinical notes. Such data can be treated as
  a temporal stream of events of varied types occurring at irregularly spaced time
  points. We focus on modeling the temporal dependencies that arise due to the types,
  timings, and values of different events in such data. We model the event streams,
  including vital signs, laboratory results contained in two different datasets (MIMIC
  III — Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care clinical database — and data extracted
  from EHRs of patients in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit) using a piecewise-constant
  conditional intensity model (PCIM), a type of marked point process. Our experiments
  capture meaningful temporal dependencies and show improvement in hospital mortality
  prediction over traditional ICU scoring systems.
