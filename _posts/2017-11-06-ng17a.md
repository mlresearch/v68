abstract: Scheduling surgeries is a challenging task due to the fundamental uncertainty
  of the clinical environment, as well as the risks and costs associated with under-
  and over-booking. We investigate neural regression algorithms to estimate the parameters
  of surgery case durations, focusing on the issue of heteroscedasticity. We seek
  to simultaneously estimate the duration of each surgery, as well as a surgery-specific
  notion of our uncertainty about its duration. Estimating this uncertainty can lead
  to more nuanced and effective scheduling strategies, as we are able to schedule
  surgeries more efficiently while allowing an informed and case-specific margin of
  error. Using surgery records from a large United States health system we demonstrate
  potential improvements on the order of 20% (in terms of minutes overbooked) compared
  to current scheduling techniques. Moreover, we demonstrate that surgery durations
  are indeed heteroscedastic. We show that models that estimate case-specific uncertainty
  better fit the data (log likelihood). Additionally, we show that the heteroscedastic
  predictions can more optimally trade off between over and under-booking minutes,
  especially when idle minutes and scheduling collisions confer disparate costs.
