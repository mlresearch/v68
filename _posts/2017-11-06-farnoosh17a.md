abstract: Wearable technologies can benefit from compressive sensing (CS) as an efficient
  signal transformation, compression, and reconstruction technique. Among such technologies,
  in-shoe pressure monitoring systems are designed to continuously record plantar
  pressure distribution for various applications ranging from medical research to
  product development in sports and healthcare. To gather adequate information from
  plantar area, a high resolution spatial pressure reading is required. However, to
  achieve a practical wearable monitoring system with long battery life at a reasonable
  price, the number of sensors in the shoe must be very limited. In this paper, we
  employed CS principles to reconstruct spatially-continuous plantar pressure distribution
  from a small number of sensors (i.e. K < 10) based on a supervised dictionary learning
  approach. The learned dictionary transforms the high-resolution pressure distribution
  to a sparse representation which is accurately reconstructable using either orthogonal
  matching pursuit (OMP) or least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
  algorithm. Using plantar pressure data from 5 participants, we demonstrated that
  our method outperforms grid-based and non-gridded interpolation techniques even
  at K = 4 sensors such that the best interpolation needs more than K = 170 sensors
  to give the same reconstruction accuracy. With K = 4 sensors, we achieved a root
  mean squares (RMS) reconstruction error of 6.7 kPa per sensing cell while the error
  remained below 16 kPa for pressure values up to 160 kPa. Our algorithm is also shown
  to be robust in presence of measurement error and limited training data, therefore
  efficiently addresses the challenges encountered in production of commercial in-shoe
  monitoring systems.
