abstract: Accurate referral to a medical specialist is a challenging part of medical
  care, especially for patients with rare diseases. Because of the diversity of rare
  diseases, finding a specialist that has experience with the particular rare disease
  is important. This burden often falls on the patients and families, but they do
  not necessarily have the time or scientific expertise to evaluate the medical literature
  to identify experts. To help patients, families, and general practitioners find
  specialists in a particular rare disease, we trained machine learning models to
  predict the expertise of researchers in every rare disease based on their publication
  record. We compile a dataset of 209,110 disease-author associations from the literature
  and evaluate the performance of six machine learning methods, classifying known
  rare disease experts with 79.4% accuracy and predicting 41,129 disease-expert associations.
